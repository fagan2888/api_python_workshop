### 3. Querying the API

#### A. Building the request
1. Import library
2. Build request (string)
3. Submit request
4. Get response

#### B. Parsing the response
1. Import library
2. Examine response
3. Extract data from response

#### C. Importing base data
1. Open file
2. Reading data from file
3. Building multiple requests with data
4. Handling errors
5. Careful with API rate limits

#### D. Exporting data
1. Creating new file
2. Writing data to new file
